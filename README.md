# Attack-Defence Exploration Tool

## 1. Description

This directory provides the implementation of the attack-defense exploration method published in the papers:

A- Salim Chehida, Abdelhakim Baouya, Marius Bozga and Saddek Bensalem, "Exploration of Impactful Countermeasures on IoT Attacks", 2020 9th Mediterranean Conference on Embedded Computing (MECO), Budva, Montenegro, 2020, pp. 1-4, doi: 10.1109/MECO49872.2020.9134200.

The input of Attack-Defense Exploration Tool is the risk assessment model composed of a set of attacks A with their characteristics (Cost, LP, UB, Env), a set of countermeasures C, ADT expressed as logic formula, and the constraints Tmax (time to perform attacks) and Cmax (budget of resources used in attacks). The output is a defense configuration DC composed of a set of impactful countermeasures.

##2. Compilation Instructions

- Java 11 is required to compile sources

- Download ANTLR v4 (version antlr-4.7-complete.jar)
from https://www.antlr.org/download/index.html.
Place the jar file into the attack-defense/lib directory.

- Use ant to compile and run the application as follows

    $ ant compile
    $ ant jar


##3. Benchmarks

Several benchmarks are included in the examples directory.
Every benchmark can be run by calling

   $ bin/adt.sh <behnchmark>.adt

where <benchmark> can be actually one of orga, bgp, scada or im.
On completion, the attack tree annotated with the most impactful defender will be exported in <benchmark>.dot.

Optional, the tool can be invoked from the ant script

   $ ant run -Dadtfile=examples/<benchmark>.adt
